        Stardew Valley is a farming simulation game primarily inspired by Story
        of Seasons, a series by Marvelous and previously known as Harvest
        Moon.[1] At the start of the game, players create a character, who
        inherits a plot of land and a small house once owned by their
        grandfather in a small village called Pelican Town, located in the
        titular Stardew Valley.
